The questions we will be trying to answer using `EDA` with `pandas` so as to provide well-informed insights are:-

1. The movie budget when creating a movie and the overall performance of high-budget or low-budget movies when it comes to income generated
2. The different genres of movies and which specific genres perform better.
3. The audience engagement with respect to reviews and rating
4. The preferred runtime  for performing movies.

## Data Analysis and Plotting

### Budget vs Worldwide Gross
![Budget vs Worldwide Gross](https://github.com/ENyawera/dsc-phase-1-project-movies/assets/111336076/b285cde0-b46c-4da6-b960-327029f34a87)

The scatter plot above shows a weak positive correlation.
Even though some high-budget movies perform better and have high world wide gross it is not reflected in all scenarios since there are some outliers of low-budget movies or medium-budget movies performing with very high worldwide gross.
This information shows budget alone cannot provide adequate insight.

### Genres vs Total Gross

The movies with the highest earnings are `Sci-fi`, `Animation` & `Adventure`.

Sci-fi movies have more reviews and a relatively high average rating.

### Run Time vs Gross

With respect to total earnings, movies with a runtime of between 140:170 minutes are preferred.
